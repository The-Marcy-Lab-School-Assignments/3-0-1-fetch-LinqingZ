# Question
Please define what each HTTP verb does. Then, provide an example of when you would use it.

- GET
- POST
- PUT/PATCH
- DELETE

# Answer
1. GET - The GET method is used to retrieve data from the server. This is a read-only method, so it has no risk of mutating or corrupting the data.

2. POST - The POST method sends data to the server and creates a new resource. The resource it creates is subordinate to some other parent resource.

3. PUT/PATCH - 
> The PUT method is most often used to update an existing resource. If you want to update a specific resource (which comes with a specific URI), you can call the PUT method to that resource URI with the request body containing the complete new version of the resource you are trying to update.


> The PATCH method is very similar to the PUT method because it also modifies an existing resource. The difference is that for the PUT method, the request body contains the complete new version, whereas for the PATCH method, the request body only needs to contain the specific changes to the resource, specifically a set of instructions describing how that resource should be changed, and the API service will create a new version according to that instruction.

4. DELETE - The DELETE method is used to delete a resource specified by its URI.
