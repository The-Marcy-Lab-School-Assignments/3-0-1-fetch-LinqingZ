# Question

Who sends the HTTP status code: the client or the server? What is the point of the status code?

# Answer
The server sends this response code to redirect the client to a different resource using the GET method. 
HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers returned by a server to indicate the outcome of a request made by a client (usually a web browser or API client). 

Informational responses (100 – 199)
Successful responses (200 – 299)
Redirection messages (300 – 399)
Client error responses (400 – 499)
Server error responses (500 – 599)
