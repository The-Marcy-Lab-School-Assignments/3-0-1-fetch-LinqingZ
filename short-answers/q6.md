# Question
`fetch` returns a promise of the `Response` object. It has a lot of useful properties on it. Can you explain what each of these properties are for?

- `Response.ok`
- `Response.status`
- `Response.url`
- `Response.headers`

# Answer

1. `Response.ok` - This property is a boolean that indicates whether the response was successful i.e., the status code is in the range 200-299.

2. `Response.status` - This property contains the HTTP status code of the response (e.g., 200 for a successful request, 404 for not found, 500 for server error).

3. `Response.url` - This property contains the URL of the response. It can be useful to verify the final URL after any redirects that may have occurred.

4. `Response.headers` - This property is an instance of the Headers interface, representing the headers associated with the response. Headers are key-value pairs containing metadata about the response.
