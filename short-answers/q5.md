# Question
What are the two arguments that we pass into `fetch` and what do they do? What does `fetch` return?

# Answer
The path to the resource is the first parameter and is required all the time, whereas the init parameter is optional. It then returns a promise that resolves into a response object.

Your answer covers the essentials, but it could be more precise and informative

1. The first argument was described as "the path to the resource." It's more accurate to describe it as the URL string specifying the resource
1. The second argument was called the "init parameter." While correct, mentioning that it is an optional configuration object and can include various settings would provide more clarity.
1. You stated that fetch returns a promise that resolves into a response object. While correct, it would be helpful to mention what the response object includes and how it can be used (e.g., methods like json(), text(), etc.).
1. Explain what the response object contains and what can be done with it.
